# Static in C++

Demonstration code of the use of static in C++ code.  Note that there are three contexts in which static can be used:

	Local scope/function
	Global scope
	Struct/Classes

Compile -

	Local scope/function - g++ -o LocalStatic LocalStatic.cpp
	Global scope - g++ -o GlobalStatic GlobalStatic.cpp Static.cpp
	Struct/Class - g++ -o ClassStatic ClassStatic.cpp

The code contains documentation outlining the various points and respective tests. In some of the files you may have to comment/uncomment some lines to see compiler reaction.
