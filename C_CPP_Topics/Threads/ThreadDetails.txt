pthreads is a C library, and was not designed with some issues critical to C++ in
mind, most importantly object lifetimes and exceptions.

pthreads provides the function pthread_cancel to cancel a thread. C++11 provides
no equivalent to this.

pthreads provides control over the size of the stack of created threads; C++11 does
not address this issue.

C++11 provides the class thread as an abstraction for a thread of execution.

C++11 provides several classes and class templates for mutexes, condition variables,
and locks , intending RAII to be used for their management.

C++11 provides a sophisticated set of function and class templates to create callable
objects and anonymous functions (lambda expressions) which are integrated into
the thread facilities.
