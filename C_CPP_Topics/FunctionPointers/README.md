# Function Pointers in C++

What is a function pointers:  facilitate assigning a function address to a variable.

Compile example with:  g++ -std=c++11 FunctionPointers.cpp

Note the general demonstration at the end where a practical use of function pointers is shown.  This gives a perspective on how functionality does not have to be completely determined at compile time; functionality choices can be dynamic at runtime...to a point.

Also note the use of auto and typedef for declaring function pointers.
